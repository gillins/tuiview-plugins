# A collection of TuiView plugins #

These plugins extend TuiView functionality. Mainly as an example of how to build plugins, but hopefully do a few useful things also. 

Instructions on how to install them are to be found in the "Installing Plugin File" section of the [TuiView Plugins Documentation](https://bitbucket.org/chchrsc/tuiview/wiki/Plugins).

Update:
This package can now be installed with 'python setup.py install'. Then run: tuiviewpluginmgr
